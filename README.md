# ModularMediaPlayer




## This project

The ModularMediaPlayer is the result of a requirement for a project using flexible MediaPlayers that are deployed via chromium and the personal desire to provide a modular option instead of the restrictive custom solution currently employed.

## The goals
The expressed Goals of this project are:

To allow media of any sort - videos - images - gifs - HTML overlays - to be displayed on any kind of resolution without any limitations in the number of concurrent active screens.

To allow media to be swapped freely by static assignment or dynamic trigger. 

To enable developers to use media in concert with their content (TODO)

To enable flexible and reliable control over content
